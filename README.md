## Files 
* reader and writer are jupyter notebooks for converting images to TfRecords 
* I used the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits). Saved around 900 of apple and red apple images into a folder for processing
* mnist.py and mnist2.py are two approaches to building a CNN for MNIST data
* mnist_spiky.py and mnist2_spiky.py are my attempts at using my own activation function for the MNIST data set. I was planning to try multiple activation functions on MNIST before moving to the main data.
